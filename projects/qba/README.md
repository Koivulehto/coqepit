Idea

I do not have a specific proof in mind. I want to formalize the Aeolus component
model and some related concepts. Then I'd like to prove some simple properties
and gradually move to more complex ones. And finally to assess if it would be
possible to formalize the Zephyrus correctness in Coq (which passes through
finite domain constraints so may be a little bit complicated).
