Project: Proof systems for dynamic modal logic

Aim:
- Implement a proof assistance based on the display calculi (~ sequent calculi) that I developped.
- Check the cut-elimination metatheroem for display calculi with a proof assistance

- Wansing, Sequent systems for modal logics
- Frittella & al, Multi-type display calculi for dynamic epistemic logic
