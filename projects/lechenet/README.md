The goal is to prove the validity of a slicing on a simple language with assertions.

This includes:
- describe the language (done)
- define the notion of quotient (done)
- define control and data dependences
- define the slicing
- define the semantics
- prove that the main program and its slice have the same semantics as far as the projection on the slicing criterion is concerned
