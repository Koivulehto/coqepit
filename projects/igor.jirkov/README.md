## Task

Prove that for arbitrary `n` holds: arithmetic average of `n` natural numbers is greater or equal to their geometric mean.

## Motivation
* It is not yet formalized

http://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/

* Probably it will lead to formalization of the forward-backward induction technique by Cauchy, which could be of a use in other places


## Proof sketch

## Possible extensions 

Real numbers would be nice (cause the relation still holds for them).

## Tools

Coq, ssreflect, probably coquelicot later.
