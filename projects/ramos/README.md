My work is the formalization of parts of the classical context-free language theory. It consists of:

- Closure properties for context-free grammars, including:
  + Grammar union (done);
  + Grammar concatenation (done);
  + Grammar closure (Kleene star) (done);
- Simplification of context-free grammars, including
  + Elimination of useless symbols (done);
  + Elimination of inaccessible symbols (done);
  + Elimination of unit rules (done);
  + Elimination of empty rules (done).
- Chomsky Normal Form (CNF) (partially done);
- Membership of a word in a context-free language using CNF (not yet done);
- Pumping Lemma for context-free languages using CNF (not yet done).

On Friday morning I would like to address the following issues, if possible:

1) How to eliminate a few admits in my formalization involving choices 
   (e.g exists ... \/ ~ exists ...);
2) How to define the language (set of words) generated by a grammar;
3) How to define a language by means of a grammar;
4) How to formulate and prove a few decidable questions;
5) How to prove the equivalence of the language generated by grammar G with
   the language generated by G' (the CNF of G), specifically from G' to G via  
   tree manipulation.

Current formalization consists of 350+ lemmas and 15.000+ lines of Coq script distributed in 20+ libraries.
