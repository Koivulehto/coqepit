I'm interested in category theory and ultimately would like to
coq-prove some stuff about monads and dense functors.

A good roadmap for that would probably be:
  * to define a category structure type
  * to prove some immediat stuff about iso/epi/mono-morphism
  * then move to the definition of functors and natural transformations

At this step, I should be able to define monads and basic stuff around
adjunction.  Although I see the basic outline of such a roadmap, I
probably will need help about the details of the implementation, the
right choice of stucture types, etc.

Ideally, I would also like to define categories of presheaves along
with some basic properties about them.
