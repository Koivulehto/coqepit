# Installing Coq

## Software Requirements

We will be using `coq 8.5.beta2` and the following Coq library and plugins:

- Coquelicot 2.1.0
- Ssreflect and Mathematical Components
- RelationAlgebra 1.2

## USB live

We are preparing USB sticks based on Ubuntu if you are unable to
install Coq on your machine. This generic solution should work on any
machine but it will be a bit slower than a direct installation on your
system. Besides, having Coq on your own system would be a better
long-term choice.

## Debian and Ubuntu

Ask Pierre-Marie PÃ©drot if you need help.

### OPAM-based installation

Follow the instructions of this [website](http://coq-blog.clarus.me/use-opam-for-coq.html).

## MacOSX

### Manual

There are packages on the official Coq [website](http://coq.inria.fr). You will have to
install libraries and plugins manually.
